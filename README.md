# Immune Checkpoints in Cancer



## Introduction


Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and multiply when they shouldn’t, which may form tumors that spread into, or invade, nearby tissue and travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors [1]. 

The immune system detects the abnormal cells and prevents the growth of many cancers, immune cells are found in surrounding cancer cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, indicating the immune system is responding to tumor growth [2]. So, the immune system can prevent or slow down cancer growth. However, cancer cells have developed mechanisms to escape destruction by the immune system, one of the most critical being immune checkpoints.

Immune checkpoints are a normal part of the immune system. This plays an important role in the immune response against pathogenic infection and in maintaining self-tolerance to minimize tissue damage [3]. In cancer, these checkpoints can be manipulated by tumors to inhibit anti-tumor immunity [3]. We will discuss the role of immune checkpoints in cancer, the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy, and their impact on cancer treatment.


## The Role of Immune Checkpoints

Immune checkpoints are molecules expressed on immune cells, such as T cells. The checkpoints include the CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4), is expressed on T cells and competes with co-stimulatory molecule CD28 for binding to B7 on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and delivering an inhibitory signal that reduces T cell activity [4]. In addition,according to  He  & Xu (2020), PD-1 (Programmed cell death protein 1) is another inhibitory receptor found on T cells and  it suppresses T cell activation and proliferation, when it binds to its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, on APCs or tumor cells , as a result reducing the immune response against the tumor. 

## Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Breakthrough in Cancer Therapy

When proteins recognize the surface of immune cells such as T cells and bind to other proteins or cancer cells are called immune checkpoint proteins that bind together and send signals to the T cells [5]. In this way, it can prevent the immune system from destroying cancer cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, an immunotherapy drug that blocks the immune checkpoint proteins from binding with other partner proteins by preventing the signal sent and allowing the T cells to kill cancer cells [5]. So, immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapy by blocking checkpoints, and the immune system is reactivated by recognizing and destroying cancer cells more effectively [6]. 

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which include monoclonal antibodies designed to block against checkpoint proteins called  CTLA-4 and PD-1 or its partner protein PD-L1 have great potential for alleviating cancer via immune activation and immunotherapy is considered a treatment option for several cancer types [7]. Some tumors turn down the T-cell response by producing lots of PD-L1 [5]. 

Ipilimumab was the first FDA-approved CTLA-4 inhibitor, showing efficacy in treating metastatic melanoma and ipilimumab enhances T-cell activation and proliferation by blocking CTLA-4 that leads to a stronger anti-tumor response [8]. On the other hand, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab are examples of PD-1 inhibitors, while Atezolizumab is an example of a PD-L1 inhibitor[9]. These drugs have shown significant clinical success in treating various cancers, including melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and renal cell carcinoma [10]. By inhibiting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, these drugs restore T cell function and enhance the immune response against tumors [11].


In this way, the Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) has changed cancer therapy by providing durable responses and survival benefits in some cancers , while traditional therapies are ineffective in some cases [12].  Although there are some challenges like some tumors developing resistance to ICIs and identifying reliable biomarkers to predict which patients will benefit from ICIs is an ongoing challenge [13].



## Conclusion


Immune checkpoints are major regulators of the immune system and the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized cancer treatment with addressing the main challenges and spreading the benefits of immune checkpoint blockade to more patients.
